= AsciidoctorJ Screenshot Extension

This AsciidoctorJ extension automates the documentation of your webapp using screenshots.
No more hassles when you change simple settings like CSS or change that button that was too big.
Your documentation stays up to date!

This extension is based on the work of https://github.com/fix/asciidoctor-screenshot[Fran√ßois-Xavier Thoorens]

== Quick reference

Basic usage is a block _takeScreenshot_ that points to a URL:
The content of the block is used as the caption of the image.

```
[takeScreenshot, url=http://google.com, name=google]
Google Landing page
```

Use a block _driveBrowser_ to control the browser (i.e. for filling in a form or doing a login)
The content of the block is passed to http://www.gebish.org/[Geb]. Geb is then taking control of the browser.

```
[driveBrowser]
go "http://google.com"
$("input", name: "q").value("asciidoctor")
waitFor(5){true}
```

The _takeScreenshot_ block supports the following parameters:

url:: the URL to point to. Optional. This is not needed when the browser was navigated to the page using a _driveBrowser_ block
